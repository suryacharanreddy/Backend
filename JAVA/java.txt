Identifiers:-
  1.Identifier should not start with numbers.
  2.Identifier should not contain any special symbols.
  3.Keyword/Reserve words should not used as Identifier.
  4.Identifier should only contain A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, $.
  5.Case sensitive.

Datatypes:-
  1.Primitive Datatypes
  2.Refrence Datatypes
  3.UserDefined Datatypes

Primitive Datatypes:-
  1.byte   Range: -128 to 127
  2.short
  3.Int
  4.long
  5.float
  6.double
  7.char
  8.boolean

Java-Array:-
  1.Group of elements in one entity
  2.Allowed Duplicates
  3.But Heterogeneous elements are not Allowed
  4.Array Elements are storing based on indexing.

Java Variables:-
  1.Instance Variables:
    I.The variable value is varied from object to object.
    II.we can assign diff value to this variable in diff methods, because it can create diff copies for diff methods.
    III.copy will create for every object.we can assign diff values for diff objects without using methods if exectution is same but values are diff.
    IV.Even if we are not Assigning value to this variable it has default value to it.
  2.Static Variables:
    I.The variable value is not varied from object to object.
    II.Only one copy will Create at class level and shared to every object.
    III.Even if we are not Assigning value to this variable it has default value to it.
  3.Local variables
    I.Local variablea can be used only in inside a method.
    II.Scope of a variable with iin the method.
    III.before we using the local variable we required initialization.
    IV.Local variable doesn't have a default value.After initialization we need a value to it otherwise it throws error.

Operators:-
  1.Arthematic
  2.Logical
  3.Relational
  4.Equality
  5.Assignment
  6.Increment/Decrement
  7.Terinory
  8.Bitwise
  9.Uninary
  10.Double colon

Control-Flow Statements:
  1.conditional Statements.
    - if-else
    - switch-case
    - Terinary
  2.Iterative Statements.
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do-while loop
    - for-each loop

Lengths:
  1.Array Length
    -array.length
  2.String Length
    -string.length()

Access Modifiers:-
  final accessmodifier:
    classes- we cant create child classes
    methods- we cant override a method.
    variables-we cant change variable value once declared.

Abstract vs Interface:
  Abstract:
  1.Abstract class contains zero or more abstract methods and also contains concrete methods.
  2.If a class contains atleast one abstract method we should declare class as abstarct.
  3.Abstract is based on methods and classes.
  Interface:-
  1.if we declare class as interface by default the methods are public and abstract.
  2.if we declare class as interface by default the variables are public and final.
  3.Interface is based on methods and variables.

OOPS:-
  1.Inheritance
  2.Abstraction:-
    A class contains 0 or more abstract methods is known as abstract class.
    If a class contains 1 or more abstract methods class must be declared as abstract class.
    Abstract classes cant create objects.Instead we can use static methods or inhertit the class.
  3.Encapsulation:-
    Binding private Variables and public methods as single encapsulation entity.


Main concepts:
  -Variables
  -Operators
  -Control Flow Statements
  -Access Modifiers


Assignments:
  int[] prices={199,129,98,78,11,171,1055};
  iterate array prices and print all prices
  1.using for loop
  2.while loop
  3.do-while
  4.for each
  5.Iterate prices print all products below 400!
  6.create new array based on existing array?
